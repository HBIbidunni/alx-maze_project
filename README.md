# The ALX Project - The Maze Game
--------------

The __maze game project__ is about creating a 3D game using raycasting techniques. 
Raycasting is a rendering technique used in computer graphics to simulate 
a `3D environment` in a `2D space`. The project is to be implemented on `Ubuntu 14.04 LTS` 
using the GCC compiler and the SDL2 and SDL2_image library for graphics and input.
